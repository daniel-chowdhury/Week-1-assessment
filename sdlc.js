// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

// answer below:

const Analysis_of_Requirements = "This is the second step, in which developers, business analysts, and client who will use the software identify the requirements that the final software product will have to meet"

const Design = "This is the third step, in which developers create the architecture of the software, break it into modules, and assign the modules to specific developer teams."

const Testing_Integration = "This is the fourth step, in which developers write the codes and individual modules are integrated to the final software. Also testers work in conjunction with developers to validate the functionality of the software and check for bugs> Sometimes developers also work as testers."

const Implementation = "This is the fifth step, software is created and deployed."

const Maintain = "This is the sixth and final step, software is maintained as the client uses the software, support is provided during crashes and failures, and periodic improvements are implemented"
